# how can we achieve the dx shown in the example form?

# we want the
#  - ability to compose form from inputs
#  - a submit hook that provides typesafe and covenient access to the inputs

# each input should be able to:
#  - render a widget that allows the user to modify its value
#  - update its values based on user input and actions
#  - validate its value

# the FormBloc is a pretty simple thing that has already been implemented

# the overall process roughly looks like this:
#  developer specifies the inputs and a submit hook
#  a form modal is created
#  a form bloc is created
#  as the user performs actions:
#   - each input whose value has changed adds the OnInputEvent to the bloc
#      with its id and updated value
#  when the user presses submit:
#   - the bloc asks each input if they are valid
#   - if each input is valid then the submit hook is trigerred

# AutoForm should not assume that we are using value objects
# but the DX should be easier if value objects areb being used
